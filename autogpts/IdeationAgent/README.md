## Overview

**IdeationAgent** aims to revolutionize the way entrepreneurs brainstorm business ideas. By just providing a LinkedIn URL and your interests, our platform leverages the power of AI to simulate a brainstorming session with four AI agents:
1. **CASEY(Researcher)** - Provides data and insights related to the idea.
2. **PAT(Devil's Advocate)** - Questions the feasibility and challenges of an idea.
3. **Lily(Angel's Advocate)** - Supports and finds potential in every idea.
4. **Steve(Cheif of Staff)** - Summarize discussions, uncover insights, and deliver them to the CEO - you. .

Together, these AI personas ensure a comprehensive discussion, covering all angles of a potential business idea.

## Features

- **User Profile Analysis**: Extracts user's skills, experiences, and expertise from LinkedIn.
- **Dynamic Discussion Simulation**: AI agents interact with each other to provide a 360¬∞ view. 
- **Human in the Loop**: The CEO and the domain expert - you, can step in and lead the discussion.
- **Real-time Insights**: Instantaneous fact-based insights from our Researcher agent.
- **Completed Business Plan**: Summarize discussions to provide a completed business plan.

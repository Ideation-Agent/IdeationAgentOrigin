## Overview

**IdeationAgent** aims to revolutionize the way entrepreneurs brainstorm business ideas. By just providing a LinkedIn URL and your interests, our platform leverages the power of AI to simulate a brainstorming session with four AI agents:
1. **CASEY(Researcher)** - Provides data and insights related to the idea.
2. **PAT(Devil's Advocate)** - Questions the feasibility and challenges of an idea.
3. **Lily(Angel's Advocate)** - Supports and finds potential in every idea.
4. **Steve(Cheif of Staff)** - Summarize discussions, uncover insights, and deliver them to the CEO - you. .

Together, these AI personas ensure a comprehensive discussion, covering all angles of a potential business idea.

## Features

- **User Profile Analysis**: Extracts user's skills, experiences, and expertise from LinkedIn.
- **Dynamic Discussion Simulation**: AI agents interact with each other to provide a 360° view. 
- **Human in the Loop**: The CEO and the domain expert - you, can step in and lead the discussion.

- **Completed Business Plan**: Summarize discussions to provide a completed business plan.

Want to build your own groundbreaking agent using AutoGPT? 🛠️ There are three major components to focus on:

### 🏗️ the Forge

**Forge your future!** The `forge` is your innovation lab. All the boilerplate code is already handled, letting you channel all your creativity into building a revolutionary agent. It's more than a starting point, it's a launchpad for your ideas. All tutorials are located [here](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/autogpts/forge/tutorials).

📘 [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/autogpts/forge)

### 🎯 the Benchmark

**Test to impress!** The `benchmark` offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.
